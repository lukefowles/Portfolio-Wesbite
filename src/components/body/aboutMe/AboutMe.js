            Hi there! My name is Luke, I'm 25 and live in London by way of Cambridge.
            I have recently started my journey into software engineering and am loving learning
            off my trainers and peers at the Bright Network Technology Academy.
            In my free time I love to watch and play sports; unfortuanely I am a self-confessed cricket tragic. 
            I also enjoy travelling and am looking forward to travel restrictions lifting again!
