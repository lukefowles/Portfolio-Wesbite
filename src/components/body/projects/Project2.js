           <p>Developed an API which allowed for CRUD operations to a PostgresSQL database. Within my team, we implemented functionality that allowed users to create a new customer, add a review to a restaurant (subsequently updating the restaurantâ€™s average rating), add a restaurant to the database, search for restaurants by criteria, and add restaurants to their favourites/Wishlist. The back-end was implemented using Java and Spring Boot, with Junit and Mockito used for unit-testing.</p>
